            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies of QuizKing ("us", "we" or "our") on the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of the QuizKing application (the "App") and any associated services, features, content or applications we offer through the App (collectively, the "Services"). We receive information about you from various sources, including without limitation: (i) if you register for the App and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your "Account"); (ii) your use of the Services generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you register for the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2>What Does Our Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers the usage of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") gathered when you access or use the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (e.g. Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) (each a "Third Party Service") that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. We do not take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services but we do encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
            <h2>What Information Is Collected?</h2>
            <p>The information we gather is done with the intent to allow us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services.

We collect, among other things, the following types of information from our users.</p>
            <h2>Account Information</h2>
            <p>When you create an account on the Services ("Account"), you may be required to provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your name, phone number and/or email address. If you register for, or access the Services using a Third Party Service (such as your social media account login credentials), we may receive Personal Information that you allow such Third Party Service to share with us. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not remain anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services. You may unsubscribe from some of these messages by emailing us at support@QuizKing.com.bd, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.</p>

By using these tools, you acknowledge that some account information from your account on the applicable Third Party Service may be transmitted into your Account with us, and that such information is covered by this Privacy Policy. If a tool, such as the Share tool, is operated by a Third Party Service, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may collect information about your activity, which would be subject to the Third Party Service's privacy policy. When using these tools, some of your information from the Services may be shared with the Third Party Service and others. Again, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of any Third Party Services, including without limitation any applicable social networks, you use in connection with the Services.
